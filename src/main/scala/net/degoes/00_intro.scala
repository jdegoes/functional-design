/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * _Functional Design_ is a technique for modeling solutions to problems in some
 * domain using _immutable values_, with a small but rich set of primitives
 * for constructing, transforming, and composing solutions in order to solve
 * even the most complex problems easily, with high testability and
 * reasonability.
 *
 * Functional Design embraces the composability, immutability, and static
 * type safety afforded by functional programming, and applies it to solve
 * real world problems, close to business domains, all without the esoteric
 * type classes, category theory jargon, confusing and undiscoverable implicits,
 * monad transformers, and other constructs common in the early days of
 * functional Scala.
 *
 * Functional Design has been used for a number of open source Scala libraries,
 * including ZIO. The techniques provide very powerful, concise, and type-safe
 * solutions to many complex problems within given domains.
 *
 * In this section, you will get a taste for the kind of expressive power,
 * compositionality, declarativity, and type-safety that Functional Design
 * can provide.
